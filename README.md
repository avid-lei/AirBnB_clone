## *Examples:*
The command
```bash
(hbnb) help create
```
will produce the following output:
```bash
Create new instance of class
```
explaining that the command "create" will create a new instance of a class.
Thus:
```bash
(hbnb) create User
```
will return ID of the newly created instance:
```bash
4e204e6f-a941-4627-b8a1-7727a793b939
```
The command:
```bash
(hbnb) show User 4e204e6f-a941-4627-b8a1-7727a793b939
```
will output all attributes of the object User:
```bash
[User] (a2c8801a-c02c-4289-9397-bef663e5b59e) {'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 14, 10, 52, 53, 299902), 'id': 'a2c8801a-c02c-4289-9397-bef663e5b59e', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 14, 10, 52, 53, 299860)}
```
To update/add a value of the object's attribute, use the command ```update``` followed by the name of the Class, instance ID, name of the attribute and its new value:
```bash
(hbnb) update User 4e204e6f-a941-4627-b8a1-7727a793b939 first_name "Diva"
```
To delete object User:
```bash
(hbnb) destroy User 4e204e6f-a941-4627-b8a1-7727a793b939
```
The following example shows an attempt to access the deleted object:
```bash
(hbnb) show User 4e204e6f-a941-4627-b8a1-7727a793b939
** no instance found **
```
Exiting the program:
```bash
(hbnb) quit
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
```
